# lab42_nested_hash

A nested hash view with dotted deep access Ã  la I18n.t of Rails and with optional string interpolation. Typically YML loaded Hashes are used.

## What is it good for?

I developped `NHash` to scratch an itch that developped when creating presentations of hierarchical data with different aspects. E.g. different languages
and different versions.

For that I wanted to combine the _data_ and define strategies what to do when compound keys were not found. Typically _data_ will be quite a big `Hash`
instance coming from _Yaml_ files, a _Json_ webservice, or a document oriented database like _MongoDB_.

But let us start slowly:

## Most Basic Example


```ruby
    h = { "a" => 1,
          "b" => { "c" => 2, "d" => true } }

    nh = NHash.new h

```

Then `get` lets us access elements

```ruby
    nh.get('a').assert == 1
    nh.get('b.c').assert == 2
```

or _subhashes_:

```ruby
    nh.get('b').assert.kind_of? NHash
```


Please see the [QED](http://rubyworks.github.io/qed/) demos [here](https://github.com/RobertDober/lab42_nested_hash/blob/master/demo) for detailed explainations and specifications of the implemented features:


### Indifferent Access

Symbol and String Keys are treated the same.

### Affixes

Prefixes and Suffixes can be predefined and used when a compound key starts and/or ends with a `.`.

### Lookup Chains

Taking advantage of the Affixes features an affixed access can look in more than one affix. E.g. to fall back
to English as the default translation language.

### Fallbacks

A more general concept of what to do if an access fails (raises a `KeyError`).

### Interpolation

If values have `ERB` syntax templates as values, the special `get!` access can be used to interpolate them
in various contexts, the `NHash` instance's binding being the default.

### Compound Values

Subhashes and subarrays maintain important context information, e.g. for _Interpolation_.

### Hierarchies

If all else fails... 
We can check in other `NHash` instances. They are organised as a _Depth First Search Tree_.

This feature is particularly interesting for complex document composition out of a hierarchical data
source tree (e.g. a set of yaml files, different for each new version/variation of the result).

### Factories

The `NHash` constructor takes a `Hash` instance (defaulting to `{}` ) as param. This implies that
much boiler blate code has to be written in order to bring in other data sources, as e.g. Yaml files.

The factories help to avoid this.

There are even helpers to create an `NHash` hierarchy from data sources.
